## Retail-Sales-Inventory-Analysis-Using-SQL ##
A complete SQL project analyzing retail sales, customer behavior, product performance, and inventory management using realistic datasets.
This project demonstrates strong SQL skills with joins, aggregations, window functions, and business KPIs used in real retail companies.

## Tables Used In This Project ##

The database contains six tables commonly used in retail analytics:

-**customers** – stores customer details like name, city, segment, and registration date.

-**products** – contains product information including name, category, cost price, and selling price.
